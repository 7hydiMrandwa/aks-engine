What is Adobe Photoshop Lightroom?
 
Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is a cloud-based service that gives you everything you need to edit, organize, store, and share your photos. Unlike Photoshop, which is mainly used for pixel-level editing and complex graphic design, Lightroom focuses on enhancing and managing your photos in a non-destructive way. That means you can always revert to the original image or apply different edits without losing quality.
 
Lightroom has two main components: Lightroom Classic and Lightroom. Lightroom Classic is the desktop-only version that offers more advanced features and a familiar interface for longtime users. Lightroom is the newer version that works across mobile, desktop, and web, and offers a more streamlined and modern experience. Both versions are included in the Creative Cloud Photography plan, along with Photoshop and other apps.
 
Why should you use Lightroom?
 
Lightroom is a great choice for anyone who wants to take their photography to the next level. Whether you shoot with a DSLR, a mirrorless camera, a smartphone, or any other device, Lightroom can help you make your photos look amazing with just a few clicks. Here are some of the benefits of using Lightroom:

- You can edit your photos anywhere, anytime. With Lightroom, you can access and edit your photos from any device, even when you're offline. Your edits will sync automatically across all your devices, so you can pick up where you left off.
